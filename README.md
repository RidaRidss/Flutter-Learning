#### step by step flutter learning

## step 1:
Install IDE Visual Studio Code or Intellij (my preference)
Install Git for Windows (I recommend Git Bash too)

## step 2:
Open CMD
Run `git clone -b master https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git`

## step 3:
Run `./flutter/bin/flutter --version` to ensure it has been installed successfully

## step 4:
Add `C:\Users\Rida\flutter\bin` to your Path environment variable

## step 5:
Restart CMD
Run `flutter doctor`

### step 5_1:
#### if you got this warning on cmd after run above command

### step 5_2:
 `flutter doctor --android-licenses`

### step 5_3:
install flutter extension in VS code

### step 5_4:
open android studio , go to sdk manager , plugins -> install Dart plugin -> restart android studio

### step 5_5:
